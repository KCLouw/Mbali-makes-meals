        <p class="bio">This is a platform to showcase my meals which I have made.
            I currently make a variety of different meals ranging from meat dishes, seafood, breakfasts and much much more.
            Recently I have added a range of healthy meals to my list for those more eager to delve into something you do not need to feel guilty about eating.
            Please find my social media links at the bottom of the page to view my meals on my other platforms as well as my contact details if you would like to get in touch with me.
